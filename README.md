## 🚀 Concept

Dreamify is a web application that allows you to generate images with AI. It uses the [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) model to generate images. The model is run on cloud with [Replicate](https://replicate.com/).

### 🎨 Stable Diffusion

[Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt.

This Diffusion Model is run on cloud with [Replicate](https://replicate.com/). Replicate is a platform for running and sharing machine learning models. Dreamify uses the Replicate API to run the model.

### ✨ User Interface

Dreamify is built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Components like the Buttons, Inputs, Modals and Progress Bar are developed with [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs), a collection of re-usable components built using [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/).

## 📦 Deployment

Dreamify is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
